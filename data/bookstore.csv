                    <h3>Book Description:</h3>
						<p>HTML5 and CSS3 are the way for the future. Prior to HTML5 and CSS3, it was difficult to design complicated animations and transformations. With the advent of HTML5 and CSS3, web design has become much simpler, and the new features that are now available help us design complex web pages with ease. These cool new features will be the standard for the future; hence, it is imperative to learn about them now.</p>
<p>HTML5 and CSS3 Transition, Transformation, and Animation will help you take advantage of the real power behind HTML5 and CSS3 and will give you a good grounding for using it in your own web pages. Each and every code sample and concept is explained in detail, and you will be provided with all the information you need to take your web pages to the next level – before all your competitors do!</p>
<p>The book starts by covering the basic concepts of HTML5 and CSS3 such as semantics, Microdata, and the Flexbox model. You will then quickly progress to intermediate concepts such as form elements and some exciting features with JavaScript APIs. The code samples provided in this book will give you a solid base by which you will then be able to understand, write, and execute your own HTML/CSS projects with transition and animations.</p>
<p>Instead of wading through loads of theory, the concepts in this book are explained in a practical manner using code samples to demonstrate the new features of HTML5 and CSS3. The code samples are such that you can copy the code (the entire code is written instead of code snippets) and execute it for better understanding. Transition, transformation, and animation are also explained in a lucid manner, and there is a gradual increase in the difficulty level throughout the book.</p>
<p>By the end of the book, you will be thoroughly acquainted with HTML5 and CSS3, enabling you to design a web page using the included code samples with ease.</p>

                    <h3>Book Description:</h3>
						<p>Procedural generation is a growing trend in game development. It allows developers to create games that are bigger and more dynamic, giving the games a higher level of replayability. Procedural generation isn’t just one technique, it’s a collection of techniques and approaches that are used together to create dynamic systems and objects. C++ is the industry-standard programming language to write computer games. It’s at the heart of most engines, and is incredibly powerful. SFML is an easy-to-use, cross-platform, and open-source multimedia library. Access to computer hardware is broken into succinct modules, making it a great choice if you want to develop cross-platform games with ease.</p>
<p>Using C++ and SFML technologies, this book will guide you through the techniques and approaches used to generate content procedurally within game development.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of this book, we’ll look at examples of these technologies, starting with setting up a roguelike project using the C++ template. We’ll then move on to using RNG with C++ data types and randomly scattering objects within a game map. We will create simple console examples to implement in a real game by creating unique and randomised game items, dynamic sprites, and effects, and procedurally generating game events. Then we will walk you through generating random game maps. At the end, we will have a retrospective look at the project.</p>
<p>By the end of the book, not only will you have a solid understanding of procedural generation, but you’ll also have a working roguelike game that you will have extended using the examples provided.</p>

<div>Code Generation with Rosyln is the first book to cover this new capability.&nbsp; You will learn how these techniques can&nbsp;be used to simplify systems integration so that if one system already defines business logic through lookup tables, you can integrate a new system and share business logic by allowing the new system to write its own business logic based on already existing table-based business logic.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>One of the many benefits you will discover is that Roslyn uses an innovative approach to compiler design, opening up the inner workings of the compiler process. You will&nbsp;learn how to see the syntax tree that Roslyn is building as it compiles your code. Additionally,&nbsp;you&nbsp;will learn to&nbsp;feed it your own syntax tree that&nbsp;you create on the fly.</p>
</div>

<div>What You Will Learn:</div>
<div></div>
<div>• Structure logic to be stored in database design</div>
<div>• Build complex conditional logic based on lookup data in the database</div>
<p>• Compile code that you generate programmatically</p>
<div>• Discover generated code and run it dynamically to implement new business logic</div>

                    <h3>Book Description:</h3>
						<p>This is a book about learning by doing and is aimed at programmers familiar with programming, but not C++. The key exercises are not simply listed at the end of the chapter, but are integrated into the main text. Readers work hands-on throughout the book. Each lesson poses numerous questions, asking readers to write answers directly in the book. The book includes answers to all questions, so readers can check their work. These exercises are not simple cookbook-style recipes (e.g., “Write a program to do xyz”). Instead, they are explorations―structured labs that guide readers through a series of steps to highlight specific features of C++.</p>
